# COLORS PALETTE CATALOG

Hi everyone!

This is actually a **simple colors palette** catalog divided in categories that I personally use for my job as a Web Developer and UI/UX Designer.

Clients are always undecided about the colors to pick for their website (or completely bewildered) that I decided to create this HTML document with a list of colors for them. This simple, nothing special!

Feel free to use it or to suggest any changes!
